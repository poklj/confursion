# Outbreak

In the mid-21st century, the world was introduced to the first public [anthropic
shift](/anthropic-shift). Union Aerospace Corporation CEO [Maarten van
Holstruk](/characters/patient-zero) was known for his eccentric interests,
occasionally flirting with the internet furry community, before disappearing
from the public eye for a number of months. When he reemerged, it was revealed
he had shifted into, appropriately enough, a marten.

In the wake of this moment, additional reports of humans undergoing anthropic
shift surfaced, and for a time it was referred to as "first infection", or the
**Outbreak**. Though Xenomics Laboratories, the company that produced the virus
responsible for anthropic shift, would later confirm the plague had been
spreading for weeks prior to van Holstruk's reveal, the date also came to be
known jokingly as "AF", for "After Furries". The change in epoch never made it
to official public use, but the anthro community happily uses it to reckon the
passage of time.
