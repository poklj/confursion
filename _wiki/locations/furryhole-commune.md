# Furryhole Commune

**Furryhole** is a small village settlement of anthros located in the foothills
east of Seattle, Washington. Originally founded by a group of internet friends
as a gathering place, the commune evolved to become a safe haven for any anthro
finding themselves cast out of their former lives. Construction began on the
great lodge several months after the Outbreak, completing about a year after.
After that, several satellite buildings were added to form what is known simply
as Furryhole.

The village lies on the shore of Spirit Lake, in a small valley overlooking the
Okanogan National Forest. The lake drains via a waterfall to Lower Spirit Lake,
before ultimately draining to the Snoqualmie River. The waterfall is used for
generating power, and for driving the sawmill and granary. Furryhole is partially self-sufficient, growing a number of exotic crops for export, including their world-famous coffee.
