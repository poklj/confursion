# Furhaven Valley

**Furhaven Valley** is a small village settlement of anthros in the foothills
east of Seattle, Washington. Originally founded by a group of internet friends
as a gathering place after their shifts, the commune evolved to become a safe
haven for any anthro finding themselves cast out of their former lives.
Construction began several months after the Outbreak, with much of the main
village completed a year later. The settlement properly consists of three
neighboring valleys: Gateway, Furhaven, and Spirit.


## Gateway

Gateway Valley houses the rail terminal for the Iron Dragon Railway, as well as
an access road, a small motel for tourists, Cattail Coffee, and the Pawsitively
Everything General Store. The rail is the main route in and out of Furhaven,
carrying supplies and new residents in, and exports out. Both road and rail wind
through the hills to the southwest before connecting with Interstate 90 and the
major regional railroads.


## Furhaven

Furhaven Valley proper holds the main village, centered around a large lake. On
the west shore stands the Great Lodge, a large chalet housing most of the
original group as well as extra rooms for rescued anthros. The village center
consists of a forge and sawmill, a small nondenominational church, an inn and
tavern, and a medical clinic dedicated to anthro physiology. A few miscellaneous
shop buildings round out the village, and a collection of cabins climbs the
valley wall above. A shuttle train passes under the mountain to connect Furhaven
to Gateway Valley, and to the Iron Dragon Railway beyond. The lake drains into a
waterfall before continuing on into the mountains, and a hydroelectric station
draws some power for the village.


## Spirit

Spirit Valley holds the farmland that supplies Furhaven's legendary food
exports, including Blue Jay Blends coffee, and the Foxfire mead. A number of
greenhouses hug the north wall of the valley, each with various experimental
strains of crops, made possible with advanced genetic modifications. A tunnel
connects Spirit Valley to Furhaven, and a small cart system follows the path
through the mountain to easily transport goods to the shuttle station and the
village.
