# Maarten van Holstruk

The eccentric billionaire CEO of Union Aerospace, **Maarten van Holstruk** has
the dubious honor of being known as patient zero of the [anthropic
shift](/anthropic-shift). Though by no means the first to have actually shifted,
preceded by numerous Xenomics Laboratories and UAC staff, his case was the first
to break into the public eye.

Following his announcement, and after the early months of political panic at the
sudden and random transformations of humans into anthros, van Holstruk became an
advocate for the growing anthro population. Years on, van Holstruk has receded
to his old, quieter life, continuing to promote the exploration of space, and
the general welfare of his fellow anthros.
