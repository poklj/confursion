## Bio

Shiny is a calico tomcat with green eyes.

He woke up one day to discover the bump he had been picking at on the base of his spine had sprouted into a full-fledged fluffy tail.

Not exactly the type of thing you can hide for too long.

As well as gardening and keeping chickens, Shiny runs Pawsitively Everything with his partner.
