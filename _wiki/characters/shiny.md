## Bio

Shiny is a calico tomcat with green eyes, a white muzzle, and a white tail tip.

He was attending a furry convention in Seattle with his boyfriend when The Shift started.

He woke up one day to discover the bump he had been picking at on the base of his spine had sprouted into a full-fledged fluffy cat tail. Not exactly the type of thing you can hide for too long.



As well as gardening and keeping chickens, Shiny runs Pawsitively Everything with his partner.
