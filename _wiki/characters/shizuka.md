## Biography

Shizuka is an English Lop rabbit with tan and cream fur, orange hair, blue eyes,
and ears that lop down nearly to her waist. She's often seen in a checked shirt,
jeans, and a slouchy hat. Her ears provide her with exceptional hearing, and
some degree of extra warmth in winter, but the increased sensitivity causes her
to be easily startled or overstimulated.

She is quiet and observant, and speaks softly when at all, as a method of
alleviating her anxiety. Her posture is generally drawn in, unassuming. Though
she is occasionally regarded as cold or distant, Shizuka warms up to new people
over time, and is considerably more talkative when around anthros she trusts.

About five months after the [Outbreak](/events/outbreak), she first noticed a
patch of fur growing on her chest. Her doctor confirmed she was undergoing an
anthropic shift into a rabbit. Her face and ears shifted while the fur finished
spreading, and finally her tail and feet shifted two weeks after she started.

In the weeks after her shift, Shizuka felt increasingly disconnected from the
humans around her. She relocated to the Pacific Northwest, chasing rumors of an
anthro-led community. There she met Marina, who visited her area of Seattle
often. The two became easy friends, and before long Marina invited Shizuka to
join Furhaven Valley. Their relationship grew while they made plans to open an
inn for refugee furs like Shizuka. A few months later, the pair opened the
Hoptimism Inn and Tavern, joined by [Jewel Wolfe](/characters/jewel) and [Trace
Lun](/characters/trace).

Shizuka makes baked goods at the Hoptimism Tavern, drawing on the farming
advancements made in Spirit Valley to produce safe ingredients for all types of
anthros. She is occasionally seen on the tavern floor for short periods of time,
preferring to remain behind the bar with Marina or in the kitchen.
 

## Rachel Valenheart

[Sixteen months](https://shizuka.hokora.page/articles/2019-02/descent) after the
Outbreak, Shizuka traveled to the abandoned Xenomics Laboratories in search of a
supposed vaccine against anthropic shift. The labs had been largely destroyed by
neglect, and what research she initially found indicated Xenomics was actually
triggering a more advanced stage of the shift, turning its own scientists into
feral animals. When she reached the innermost chamber, she discovered a small
anthro in a near-feral state, whom she brought back to Furhaven.

Rachel Valenheart is a Mini Lop rabbit anthro, only a few feet tall, with
golden brown fur and brown eyes. Her only identifiably human features are in her
posture, sitting upright, resembling a stuffed animal more than an anthro. She
is mute, and communicates by writing on a notepad, or through a form of empathic
connection with her adoptive mother. Rachel remembers almost nothing before her
shift, and is unsure whether her advanced changes happened naturally or were
induced by Xenomics research. Like nearly all anthros, she is content with her
form, and happily lives with Shizuka and Marina at the Lodge.
